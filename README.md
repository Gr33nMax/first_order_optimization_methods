# First Order Optimization Methods
Implementation of the optimization methods for an objective function

# Description
This script helps to minimize the objective function. It implements such methods as:
* 2-point method of dividing the segment in half
* 3-point method of dividing the segment in half
* The golden ratio method
* Fibonacci method
* Quadratic interpolation method

And shows the number of iterations spent by each method. And also displays a graph with an interval at which there is a minimum.

# Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- NumPy
- MatPlotLib
- Pylab
